My New York Times App is using the Top Stories section of the API from the newspaper NewYorkTimes. 
You can either choose to access the homepage or get the article per section.
It is also possible to save you favorite articles with the help of CoreData.

The architecture of this project is following the rules of the MVVM-C pattern, if you are willing to see more about my comprehension of it, I encourage you to read the article I published on Medium at this address : https://medium.com/better-programming/the-art-of-mvvm-c-pattern-6fb9def2bb66

The logic of the App is 100% tested (ViewModel's). Press cmd + U and dive into the magic green land. üßù‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The App is built in 3 tabs :

### Feed

In this Tab are displayed all the article currently on the New York Times homepage.

### Categories

A tableView allowing you to choose a topic among the available sections of the New York Times Top Stories API.

### Favorites

Here you will find all the articles that you saved.

##### Thanks for reading, enjoy the App üöÄ
